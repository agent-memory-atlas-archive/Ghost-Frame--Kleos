//! Tenant-database migration chain.
//!
//! Each tenant shard has its own independent migration version tracked in the
//! `schema_migrations` table inside the tenant's own SQLite file. The version
//! sequence here is NOT related to the system/main migration sequence in
//! `super::migrations` -- system and tenant schemas evolve on separate
//! timelines.
//!
//! Migrations run lazily on tenant load (via `Database::open_tenant`). A new
//! tenant gets v1 applied; an existing tenant at v1 gets nothing until a new
//! version is appended to `TENANT_MIGRATIONS`.
